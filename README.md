<img src=readmefile/parkingabcST.png width=80% />

The backend of the website is built by ```Spring Boot``` framework, initially encapsulated in ```Docker``` and then deployed on ```Amazon EC2``` servers, while also configured with ```NGINX``` as a ```reverse proxy```, and utilizing SSL/TLS certificates from ```Letâ€™s Encrypt``` to ensure secure ```HTTPS``` connections. Data is stored in a ```MySQL``` database managed by ```Amazon RDS```. In order to show the information changing immediately, ```Redis``` and ```Websocket``` are used. Static resources such as images and style sheets are stored on ```Amazon S3```, with content distribution accelerated through ```Amazon CloudFront``` for enhanced access speed.

## Database
